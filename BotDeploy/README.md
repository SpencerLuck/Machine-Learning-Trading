# Trading bot

This is an example the script of a trading bot that would be deloyed live. The script is tailored toward creating a trading bot from a machine learning model. In other words we are converting model predictions/expectations into trading logic that will execute trades live in the market. Additionally we are managing open positions and exiting positions if exit conditions, based on model predictions, are fulfilled.
